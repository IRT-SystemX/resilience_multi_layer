# resilience_multi_layer
Datasheet and scripts for the resilience assessment of multi-layered SWaT.
- SWaT_P1_components.csv contains the components of the SWaT pumping stage,
- SWaT_P1_data.txt is used to build the knowledge graphs (with neo4j) of the SWaT pumping stage layers,
- SWaT_P1_eigenvector.xlsx contains the resilience analysis made by applying the eigenvector centrality property to the knowledge graphs.
